Hi, I’m Lynnniee — currently studying MSc Business Analytics in Imperial College London.

I’m passionate about combining finance and data, and I’m learning Python to build small, practical projects that solve real problems. I created this blog to document my progress, share project ideas, and reflect on what I’ve learned.

Through this space, I hope to grow my skills, showcase my portfolio, and connect with others interested in finance, analytics, and coding.

Thanks for visiting!
